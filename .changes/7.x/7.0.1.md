## 7.0.1 - 2023-11-14

### Changed

- CompatInfo 7.0.1 will be the last version to support PHP 8.0; 8.1 and 8.2 will be accepted but not 8.3
- `tests/bootstrap.php` file to prevent PHPUnit to failed with error if database is not built and populate (launch auto diagnose)

### Fixed

- Misunderstood the [RFC](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/same-site-cookie). The first suggestion with additional argument was never implemented
- [#363](https://github.com/llaville/php-compatinfo/issues/363) : PHP 8.2 features support
