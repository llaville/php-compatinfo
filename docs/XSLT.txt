There are several XSLT scripts which can be used to transform the XML report 
into some nice html pages. 

To do this, make sure you've first generate the XML report, i.e:
----
 $ phpci --report xml --report-file <report.xml> print <dataSource>
----

And then use the xslt processor to transform the XML to a beautiful XHTML page.
----
 $ xsltproc -o <output_page.html> summary.xsl <report.xml>
----
