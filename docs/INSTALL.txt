== PEAR

PHP_CompatInfo should be installed using the http://pear.php.net/[PEAR Installer].
This installer is the backbone of PEAR, which provides a distribution system
for PHP packages, and is shipped with every release of PHP since version 4.3.0.

----
$ pear channel-discover bartlett.laurent-laville.org

----

== Git

You can also clone the project.
----
$ git clone git://github.com/llaville/php-compat-info.git && cd php-compat-info
----

Copy the `PHP` sub-folder in a `Bartlett` directory
accessible by your `include_path`.

.When [label]#include_path# is equals to [label]#.:/php/includes#
====
----
$ mkdir /php/includes/Bartlett && cp PHP/* /php/includes/Bartlett
----

WARNING: Don't forget to install also all others required dependencies:
`PHP_Reflect`, `Console_CommandLine`,
and http://components.ez.no[eZ Components] `Base`, `ConsoleTools`.

Check that it works. Run the local [label label-inverse]#phpci# command.
