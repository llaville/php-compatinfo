PHP_CompatInfo is a PHP library that will parse source code (file, directory)
to find out the minimum version and extensions required for it to run. 
A CLI tool is available, giving results without having to write a line of code.

The major version 2 is a full rewrite to PHP5 that uses exceptions to raise
errors, and an autoloader to dynamically load required classes.

Since version 2.0.0RC3 the PHP parser engine used is https://github.com/llaville/php-reflect[PHP_Reflect].
It's an improved version from the basic concept of https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/php-token-stream[PHP_TokenStream].

If you want a PHP4-compatible version, you should consider to have a look on the
branch 1.x solution hosted on PEAR repository :
http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_CompatInfo[PEAR::PHP_CompatInfo] 1.9.0

CAUTION: Its recommended to migrate to PHP5, because the PHP4 version is not maintained anymore.
