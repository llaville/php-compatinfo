== Introduction

PHP_CompatInfo is a PHP library that parse any data source (file/folder/mixed)
to find out the minimum version and extensions required for it to run. 
A CLI tool is available, giving results without to have to code a line of programmation.

The major version 2 is a full rewrites to PHP5, that used exceptions to raise
errors, and an autoloader to dynamically load required classes.

If you want a PHP4 version compatible, you should consider to have a look on the
branch 1.x solution hosted on PEAR repository :

* link:http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_CompatInfo[PEAR::PHP_CompatInfo] 1.9.0 

CAUTION: I recommand to migrate to PHP5, because I don't gave anymore support for PHP4 versions

This manual documents the final stable version {revnumber}

== Installing PHP_CompatInfo

NOTE: The current version of PHP_CompatInfo requires *PHP 5.2.0 or newer*
to run.  If you don't already have an up-to-date version of PHP
installed it can be downloaded from the official PHP website
http://www.php.net/.

=== Using PEAR installer

PHP_CompatInfo should be installed using the [PEAR Installer](http://pear.php.net/). 
This installer is the backbone of PEAR, which provides a distribution system for PHP packages, 
and is shipped with every release of PHP since version 4.3.0.

The PEAR channel (_bartlett.laurent-laville.org_) that is used to distribute PHP_CompatInfo 
needs to be registered with the local PEAR environment. 
Furthermore, components that PHP_CompatInfo depends upon is hosted on the eZ Components PEAR channel (_components.ez.no_),
and on the PHPUnit PEAR channel (_pear.phpunit.de_).

----
    $ pear channel-discover bartlett.laurent-laville.org
    Adding Channel "bartlett.laurent-laville.org" succeeded
    Discovery of channel "bartlett.laurent-laville.org" succeeded

    $ pear channel-discover components.ez.no
    Adding Channel "components.ez.no" succeeded
    Discovery of channel "components.ez.no" succeeded

    $ pear channel-discover pear.phpunit.de
    Adding Channel "pear.phpunit.de" succeeded
    Discovery of channel "pear.phpunit.de" succeeded
----    
This has to be done only once. Now the PEAR Installer can be used to install packages from the Bartlett channel.
